HOW TO COPY LATEST DEV VERSION OF NGPS SOFTWARE TO DEPLOYMENT COMPUTER

1) Push C++ and Python code on ngps-devel and pull from ngps

Push/pull /home/developer/Software
Push/pull /home/developer/Software/Python/***   (acam_skyinfo, OTM, ETC)


2) Deploy latest GUI to both NGPS computers.  From ngps-devel:

First, build the local version: On VNC, open project in Netbeans and do Run > Clean and Build Project.
Now copy this built version to deployment locations in /usr/local/ on both machines:

cd /home/developer/Software/java/ngps/ngps
./deploy   # copies built version, not the dev version you get with the Netbeans "play" or "run" button


3) Sync Desktops.  From ngps-devel:

su observer
rsync -avz ~/Desktop/ ngps.caltech.edu:~/Desktop  ## keep / in source path
su developer
rsync -avz ~/Desktop/ ngps.caltech.edu:~/Desktop  ## keep / in source path


4) Sync MYSQL. You must first backup the deployed database.
Details in .../Software/mysql/HOWTO-BACKUP.txt

cd /home/developer/Software/mysql
./backup-all.sh

STOP if any errors occur during backup.  Database changes (next steps) cannot be easily rewinded.

cd local-schema

skeema diff deploy -p  # Compares local copy to remote -- try as test
skeema push deploy -p  # Replaces remote schema with local copy.  !! CAN'T UNDO !!
