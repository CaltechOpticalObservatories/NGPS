HOW TO COPY LATEST DEV VERSION OF NGPS SOFTWARE TO DEPLOYMENT COMPUTER

1) Push C++ and Python code on ngps-devel and pull from ngps

Push/pull /home/developer/Software
Push/pull /home/developer/Software/Python/***   (acam_skyinfo, OTM, ETC)


2) Deploy latest GUI to both NGPS computers.  From ngps-devel:

cd /home/developer/Software/java/ngps/ngps
./deploy   # copies built version, not the dev version in netbeans


3) Sync Desktops.  From ngps-devel:

su observer
rsync -avz ~/Desktop/ ngps.caltech.edu:~/Desktop  ## keep / in source path
su developer
rsync -avz ~/Desktop/ ngps.caltech.edu:~/Desktop  ## keep / in source path


4) Sync MYSQL. This will REPLACE the deployed database.
If that's not what you want, mysql changes have to be synced manually
From ngps-devel:

mysqldump --user=root -p ngps > backup-ngps.sql
mysqldump --user=root -p telemetry > backup-telemetry.sql

scp these files to ngps

On the deployment computer:

To restore, create an empty database with the correct name e.g. ngps.  Then:
mysql --user=root -p ngps < backup-ngps.sql

To restore users, log into mysql as root and do  
mysql> source mysql-users.sql;
