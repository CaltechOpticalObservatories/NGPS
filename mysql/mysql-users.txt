/* 
User permissions are set on a “need to have” basis to increase security and reduce accidental data loss.  
Except for root, user passwords will generally be exposed in the code.

•	root
•	maybe we need a secure user with read-only on all tables?
•	telemlogger – write-only to any table in telemetry
•	obseq – permissions needed by Observation Sequencer on ngps
•	gui – most permissions allowed on ngps
•	grafana – read only from telemetry
•	drp – write-only to science

If EXECUTE is needed, must apply to db not 1 table:
GRANT EXECUTE ON db.* TO user@'%';
