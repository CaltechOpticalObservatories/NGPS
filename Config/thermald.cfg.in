# Each Lakeshore is assigned a unit number, host, and port
# set as follows: LKS_UNIT="LKS# MODEL NAME HOST PORT"
# where LKS#  is an arbitrary unit number used to cross-reference LKS_CHAN below.
#       MODEL is the model number, e.g. "218, 325, 340, 336".
#       NAME  is any string, used as a helpful identifier in logging and the UI.
#             This must be unique and must not contain spaces.
#       HOST  the hostname for connecting to this Lakeshore.
#       PORT  the port number on HOST for connecting to this Lakeshore.
# An LKS_UNIT must be defined before any LKS_CHAN(s).

# Each Lakeshore channel is assigned using a Lakeshore Channel Key (LKS_CHAN)
# set as follows: LKS_CHAN="LKS# CHAN# LABEL"
#
# The LKS# here must have a corresponding LKS# set in an LKS_UNIT above,
# and the LKS_UNIT must be defined first, before the LKS channels are
# assigned below.
#
# CHAN# is a standard Lakeshore channel name (A, B, C1, 1, 2, 3, etc.)
# and should be preceeded by an "H" to designate a heater (H1, H2, etc.).
#
# LABEL is a text string label for that channel. It can be any alphanumeric
# string except it must not contain spaces, and it should be unique across
# all LKS units so that it can be used for identifying channels (although
# channels can still be identified by LKS# CHAN# even if LABEL is not unique).
