# Camera preamble
#
# These commands are sent to the camera daemon on startup.
# There can be multiple commands, use one line for each command.
# Commands with space-delimted arguments should be enclosed in parentheses.
# Commands will be sent in the order as they appear here.
# To send a command to a specific camera, include the PCI device number(s)
# or camera ID(s), e.g. (0 readout L1) or (G R readout U2). If not included
# then that command will be sent to all cameras that were opened with the
# first (open . . .) command.
