# For each actuator's controller specify: address name referencetype
# address is the DIP-switch assigned address
# name will be used to identify which device to move, and in STEPPER_POS below
# One must be named "filter" and the other must be named "cover"
# referencetypes are { neg, pos, ref }

# For each motor controller, assign possible positions with STEPPER_POS
# STEPPER_POS="name ID position positionname"
# name must have a corresponding name in STEPPER_CONTROLLER above, which must be defined first
# ID is a 0-based incremental internal ID number {0,1,2,...}
# position is the real actuator position required to reach location ID
# positionname is the name of that position (what the user will use)
#

# These are for the Filter Wheel -- OK to change positionname as required!
# positionname is the filter name used to select the filter.
# ID here refers to the numbered positions on the filter. Do not change
# the position for a given ID. See orientation diagram below.
