# For each actuator's controller specify:

#   <addr>  Address is DIP-switch assigned PI address.
#   <name>  name of controller
#   <ref>   reference type: {neg|pos|ref}

#   <max>   max allowed motion

# For each motor controller, assign possible positions with MOTOR_POS
# MOTOR_POS="name ID position positionname"
# name must have a corresponding name in MOTOR_CONTROLLER above, which must be defined first
# ID is a 0-based incremental internal ID number {0,1,2,...}
# position is the real actuator position required to reach location ID
# positionname is the name of that position (what the user will use)
