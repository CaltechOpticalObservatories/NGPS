NGPS Guider DS9 Display
-----------------------

Most DS9 features will work as usual, but the user is limited to the
crosshairs tool in the Edit menu.   Creating new frames and regions in 
this DS9 window is discouraged and may lead to weird effects.
To work with regions, frames, and so on, use the
[grab fits] button to copy to a new DS9 session.  

Buttons:

[sync display] -- Update displayed parameters with the current guider settings

[camera settings] -- Update the camera with new settings

[grab fits] -- Copy current FITS frame to a separate DS9 window for analysis
  (also saves in /data/acam/grab/)

[put on slit] -- NOT IMPLEMENTED.  Move the spectrograph slit to the coordinates of the
  crosshairs. User can zoom in first for more precision.
