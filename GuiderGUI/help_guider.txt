NGPS Guider DS9 Display
-----------------------

Most DS9 features will work as usual, but the user is limited to the
crosshairs tool in the Edit menu.   Creating new frames and regions in 
this DS9 window is discouraged and may lead to weird effects.
To work with regions, frames, and so on, use the
[grab fits] button to copy to a new DS9 session.  

Buttons:

[sync GUI] -- Update camera settings menu with the current guider settings. Zoom to fit.

[camera settings] -- Update the camera with new settings.

[grab fits] -- Copy current FITS frame to a separate DS9 window for analysis
  (also saves in /data/acam/grab/).  PLEASE DON'T MASH THE BUTTON.

[gui help] -- This message

[show slit] -- Zoom to show the location of the spectrograph slit.

[focus] -- Change the focus position of the P200.

[put on slit] -- Move the spectrograph slit to the coordinates
 of the crosshairs. User can zoom in first for more precision.

[guide] -- Start guiding to hold the current telescope position.

[stop] -- Stop guiding.

Troubleshooting:

WHERE IS THE SETTINGS DISPLAY?  The current camera settings are displayed at 
 the bottom of the image.  If they are not visible, try zooming out.

SEEING WEIRD VALUES?  Try pressing [sync camera].
