NGPS Guider DS9 Display
-----------------------

Most DS9 features will work as usual, but the user is limited to the
crosshairs tool in the Edit menu.   Creating new frames and regions in 
this DS9 window is discouraged and may lead to weird effects.
To work with regions, frames, and so on, use the
[grab fits] button to copy to a new DS9 session.  

Buttons:

[sync camera] -- Update camera settings menu with the current guider settings. Zoom to fit.

[camera settings] -- Update the camera with new settings.

[grab fits] -- Copy current FITS frame to a separate DS9 window for analysis
  (also saves in /data/slicecam/grab/).  PLEASE DON'T MASH THE BUTTON.

[gui help] -- This message

[jog settings] -- Set the offset size (arcsec) of the jog buttons

[left / right / up / down] -- Offset the image; LEFT button will result in the IMAGE moving LEFT, and so on.

[put on slit] -- Offset the telescope to put the spectrograph slit at the coordinates of the
  crosshairs. User can zoom in first for more precision.

[put on guider] -- Offset the telescope so that the crosshairs coordinates are visbile on the guider camera.
